Typing Master Project

Introduction:
The Typing Master project is a desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter. Its main goal is to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy through practice and interactive exercises.

Features:

Typing Practice: Users can practice typing by typing out random words, sentences, or paragraphs displayed on the screen.
Customizable Settings: Users can customize the difficulty level, including the length and complexity of the text to type.
Typing Tests: Users can take timed typing tests to measure their typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy.
Progress Tracking: The application keeps track of the user's progress over time, including their typing speed improvements.
User Profiles: Users can create profiles to track their individual progress and compare their results with others.
Interactive UI: The application features a user-friendly interface with interactive elements for a more engaging user experience.
Error Detection: The application can detect and highlight typing errors, helping users identify and correct mistakes.
Leaderboard: A leaderboard displays top performers based on typing speed and accuracy, providing motivation for users to improve.
User Interaction:

Main Menu: Users start by selecting an option from the main menu, such as practicing typing, taking a typing test, or viewing their progress.
Typing Practice: In the typing practice mode, users are presented with a text to type. As they type, the application provides real-time feedback, including highlighting errors.
Typing Tests: Users can choose a typing test duration and difficulty level. The application then presents a passage for them to type within the specified time limit.
Progress Tracking: Users can view their typing speed and accuracy over time in a graphical format, allowing them to track their improvement.
Settings: Users can customize various settings, such as the text font, background color, and typing speed goals.
How It Works:

Text Display: The application randomly selects a passage from a database of texts or allows users to input their own text.
Typing Input: Users type the displayed text into a text box provided by the application.
Error Detection: The application compares the typed text with the original passage to detect errors, highlighting them for the user to correct.
Feedback: Users receive real-time feedback on their typing speed and accuracy, encouraging them to improve.
Progress Tracking: The application stores user data, such as typing speed and accuracy, to track their progress over time.
Conclusion:
The Typing Master project is an interactive and engaging application designed to help users improve their typing skills. With its customizable settings, progress tracking, and interactive exercises, the application provides an effective platform for users to enhance their typing speed and accuracy.
